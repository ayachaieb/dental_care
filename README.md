Dental_Care:
Caries Detection System
Overview
This project focuses on developing a dental care solution that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect dental caries (tooth decay). The system analyzes dental images to identify signs of decay, helping both dental professionals and individuals monitor their oral health.

The project leverages image processing and machine learning to build a model capable of recognizing caries in dental images.
This can be integrated into a broader dental care platform or used as a standalone diagnostic tool.

Objectives
The primary objectives of the Dental_Care project are:

To build a machine learning model that accurately detects dental caries in images.
To apply image processing techniques for feature extraction from dental images.
To develop a user-friendly interface for dental practitioners or patients to upload images and receive diagnostic feedback.
To raise awareness of dental hygiene by providing accessible, automated dental care solutions.
